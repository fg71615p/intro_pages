			Hi! I'm a senior, and this is my last semester as an undergraduate at Pace! I'm also CS major; this is actually the first CIT class I've taken. However, I'm not totally in the dark, as I have at least some degree of previous experience with Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JavaScript was actually the first programming language I ever learned, back when I was in high school).

			On my spare time, I make mods for video games such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. With these mods, I can make modifications to the game and create new content. It's a lot of fun! Other people can download my mods and install them on their version of the game! All my mods are on my <a href="https://github.com/OlvynChuru">GitHub account</a>, though you won't be able to install them unless you have one of these games. I worked on one of these mods in a team with a group of people online, giving me my first experience of using GitHub to code collaboratively!
        </p>

			I am currently working on my Honors thesis, for which I am creating a website of my own. Hopefully I will be able to make good use of the knowledge gained from this class for my website!
